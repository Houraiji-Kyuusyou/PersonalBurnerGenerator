personal-burner-generator-power-output=The amount of power generated by the personal burner generator, in kW.\n\nDefault is 200 kW. (Equipment is 4x2, so 25kW per equipment grid tile.)\n\nFor comparison:\n- Portable solar panel: 30kW during the day\n      (1x1, < 30kW per tile on average)\n- Portable fission reactor: 750kW (4x4, ~46kW per tile)\n- Portable fusion reactor: 2.5MW (4x4, ~156kW per tile)
personal-burner-generator-pollution-output=The amount of pollution generated per minute by the personal burner generator.
personal-burner-generator-fuel-efficiency=Defines how efficiently the generator consumes fuel.\n\nDefault is 1.0. (100% efficiency)
personal-burner-generator-burner-inventory-size=The number of fuel slots in the personal burner generator's inventory.\n\nDefault is 4.
